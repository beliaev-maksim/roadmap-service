## 1. Feature Description

Create and maintain a comprehensive project architecture document. This document will capture all major architectural decisions, component designs, and data flows from past and current implementations. It must serve as a single source of truth for the repository's current state, providing a clear reference for developers and stakeholders.

## 2. User Scenarios & Testing

### User Scenarios

- **As a new developer**, I want to read the architecture document to quickly understand the project's structure, key components, and how they interact, so I can start contributing faster.
- **As a senior developer**, I want to reference the architecture document to ensure my new feature aligns with the existing design principles and patterns.
- **As a product manager**, I want to review the architecture document to understand the system's capabilities and constraints when planning new features.
- **As a DevOps engineer**, I want to consult the architecture document to understand the deployment and operational requirements of the system.

### Acceptance Criteria

- The document accurately reflects the current state of the `backend` and `frontend` applications.
- The document is written in a clear and understandable manner for both technical and non-technical audiences.
- The document is located in a discoverable location within the repository.
- The document includes diagrams for data flow and component interactions.

## 3. Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-1 | The architecture document must be created as a Markdown file. |
| FR-2 | The document must be located at the root of the repository in a `docs` directory. |
| FR-3 | The document must include sections for: Introduction, Backend Architecture, Frontend Architecture, Data Model, and Deployment. |
| FR-4 | The **Backend Architecture** section must detail the FastAPI application structure, API endpoints, and service layer components. |
| FR-5 | The **Frontend Architecture** section must describe the React application, including component structure, state management, and API interactions. |
| FR-6 | The **Data Model** section must explain the database schema and the relationships between entities. |
| FR-7 | The **Deployment** section must outline the containerization strategy using Docker and the deployment process. |
| FR-8 | A pre-merge pipeline check must require developers to confirm the architecture documentation is updated for any feature that impacts the architecture. |
| FR-9 | Important logic like color code calculation and similar is well documented. |

## 4. Success Criteria

- New developers can successfully set up their local environment and run the application using only the architecture document and the `README.md` files.
- The time required for a new developer to make their first meaningful contribution is reduced by 30%.
- Architectural drift is reduced, with 95% of new pull requests adhering to the documented patterns.

## 5. Assumptions

- The project will continue to use FastAPI for the backend and React for the frontend.
- The primary audience for this document is the internal development team.

## 6. Dependencies

- None.
