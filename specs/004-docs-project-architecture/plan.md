# Implementation Plan: Project Architecture Documentation

## 1. Technical Context

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11)
- **Frontend**: React (JavaScript/JSX)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (inferred from `db_schema.sql`)
- **Deployment**: Docker
- **Goal**: Create a comprehensive architecture document using the C4 model to be stored in the repository.

## 2. Constitution Check

*This section is skipped as the constitution file was not found.*

## 3. Phase 0: Research

### Research Tasks

1.  **C4 Model for Existing Architecture**: Research best practices for applying the C4 model (Context, Containers, Components, Code) to an existing project with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.
2.  **Tooling for C4 Diagrams**: Investigate lightweight, text-based tools for generating C4 diagrams from Markdown (e.g., Mermaid.js, PlantUML, or Structurizr Lite) that can be embedded directly into the documentation.

### Research Findings

*This section will be filled after research is complete.*

## 4. Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Documentation Structure (C4 Model)

The architecture documentation will be structured into multiple Markdown files within a new `docs/architecture` directory, following the C4 model.

1.  **`c1-context.md`**: System Context diagram showing the roadmap service, its users (Developers, Product Managers), and its interactions with external systems (Jira).
2.  **`c2-containers.md`**: Container diagram illustrating the high-level technical components:
    *   Frontend (React SPA)
    *   Backend (FastAPI REST API)
    *   Database (PostgreSQL)
3.  **`c3-components.md`**: Component diagrams for both the frontend and backend containers, detailing their internal modules and responsibilities.
    *   **Backend Components**: API Controllers, Services, Data Access Layer, Jira Sync module.
    *   **Frontend Components**: Pages, UI Components, API service layer.
4.  **`c4-code.md`**: (Optional) Links to key source code files or directories that represent the components described in C3, providing a direct path for developers to explore the implementation.

### Data Model

Not applicable for this feature, as it focuses on documenting the existing architecture rather than creating new data entities.

### API Contracts

Not applicable for this feature.

### Quickstart Guide

A `quickstart.md` will be created to explain how to contribute to the architecture documentation, including:
- How to update diagrams.
- The process for reflecting new architectural changes.
- The pre-merge pipeline check for documentation updates.

## 5. Phase 2: Implementation Plan

| Task ID | Description | Effort (hours) |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | Create `docs/architecture` directory structure. | 0.5 |
| T2 | Write `c1-context.md` with a system context diagram. | 2 |
| T3 | Write `c2-containers.md` with a container diagram. | 2 |
| T4 | Write `c3-components.md` for the backend. | 3 |
| T5 | Write `c3-components.md` for the frontend. | 3 |
| T6 | Create the `quickstart.md` for documentation contributions. | 2 |
| T7 | Implement the pre-merge pipeline check to enforce documentation updates. | 4 |
