# Implementation Plan: Jira Roadmap Visualization Web App

**Branch**: `001-build-a-web` | **Date**: 2025-10-07 | **Spec**: [spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-a-web/spec.md`

## Summary

A web application to visualize the engineering roadmap using data from Jira. Each roadmap item is a Jira epic, with color-coded health indicators and filtering by department, team, product, and Ubuntu release cycle. Backend uses FastAPI with minimal dependencies; frontend provides user and admin views with a modern UI. Data is stored persistently to avoid continuous API polling.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11 (FastAPI backend), JavaScript/TypeScript (frontend, framework TBD)  
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, requests/httpx, minimal frontend framework (React or Vue recommended)  
**Storage**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (PostgreSQL recommended, but any ACID-compliant store acceptable)  
**Testing**: pytest (backend), Jest or equivalent (frontend)  
**Target Platform**: Linux server (backend), modern browsers (frontend)  
**Project Type**: Web application (backend + frontend)  
**Performance Goals**: Roadmap view loads 1,000 epics in <10s; filters update in <2s  
**Constraints**: Minimal library usage, persistent storage required, must avoid continuous API polling  
**Scale/Scope**: 20+ teams, 1,000+ epics, multiple products and cycles

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- API Contract: Will provide OpenAPI spec for backend endpoints (TODO: generate in Phase 1)
- Test Coverage: Will provide pytest and frontend test definitions (TODO: generate in Phase 1)
- Observability: Will add structured logging, basic metrics (TODO: specify in Phase 1)
- Versioning Impact: Initial release, semver 0.1.0; future contract changes will follow semver
- Security: No sensitive data stored; access control for admin views (TODO: threat model in Phase 1)

```

**Structure Decision**: Split backend (FastAPI) and frontend (modern JS framework) for clear separation. Backend handles data sync, storage, and API; frontend provides user/admin views and filtering. Storage layer to be finalized in research phase.

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Persistent storage | Avoids continuous API polling | Direct API polling would cause rate limits and poor UX |
| Separate admin view | Required for roadmap management | Single view would not support admin workflows |
