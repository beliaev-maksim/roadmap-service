# Phase 0 Research: Jira Roadmap Visualization Web App

## Unknowns & Research Tasks

- Storage choice for persistent roadmap data (PostgreSQL recommended, alternatives considered)
- Frontend framework selection (React vs Vue vs others)
- Best practices for FastAPI in production
- Best practices for frontend filtering and modern UI

---

## Research Findings

### Storage Choice
- **Decision**: PostgreSQL selected for persistent storage of roadmap data.
- **Rationale**: ACID compliance, wide support, easy integration with FastAPI, scalable for 1,000+ epics.
- **Alternatives considered**: SQLite (not scalable), MongoDB (less suited for relational data), Redis (not persistent enough).

### Frontend Framework
- **Decision**: React selected for frontend development.
- **Rationale**: Mature ecosystem, strong support for modern UI, easy integration with admin/user views, good filtering libraries.
- **Alternatives considered**: Vue (also suitable), Angular (more complex for small teams).

### FastAPI Best Practices
- Use Pydantic models for validation.
- Add OpenAPI schema for all endpoints.
- Use async endpoints for scalability.
- Add structured logging and metrics (prometheus).
- Use dependency injection for services.

### Frontend Best Practices
- Use component-based architecture (React).
- Implement filtering with memoized selectors for performance.
- Use modern CSS frameworks (Tailwind, Material UI) for a clean look.
- Separate user and admin views with role-based routing.
