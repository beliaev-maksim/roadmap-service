## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

The following gates are derived from the repository Constitution and MUST be
addressed in the plan (attach artifacts or TODOs if not yet available):

- API Contract: A versioned contract (OpenAPI, gRPC proto, or contract doc)
  MUST be attached or referenced for any public API changes. If the work is
  internal-only, state that explicitly and justify.  
- Test Coverage: Provide test-first artifacts: unit/contract/acceptance tests
  (or failing test definitions) covering the feature's public behaviour.  
- Observability: List required metrics, logs, and tracing spans the feature
  will add. Include health/readiness probe changes if applicable.  
- Versioning Impact: Declare whether the change affects public contracts and
  specify the expected semver bump (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH) and migration plan if
  incompatible.  
- Security: Note any security or privilege changes and attach a short threat
  model or approval note if the change expands attack surface or requires
  elevated access.

Use this section to call out any TODOs where artifacts are pending; every
open TODO should be paired with an owner and ETA.

# Development Plan: Modernize Roadmap View

**Feature Branch**: `003-ui-upgrade-the`
**Specification**: `spec.md`
**Status**: Draft

## High-Level Plan

1.  **Component Scaffolding (Frontend)**: Create the new React components for the table view.
2.  **Static Rendering (Frontend)**: Render the table with mock data to validate the layout and styling.
3.  **Data Integration (Frontend)**: Connect the components to the live API data.
4.  **Filtering Logic (Frontend)**: Implement the dynamic filtering and column-hiding logic.
5.  **Testing**: Write comprehensive unit and integration tests.
6.  **Review and Refine**: Code review, quality assurance, and final adjustments.

## Detailed Task Breakdown

### Frontend

**Task 1: Create `RoadmapTable` Component**

-   **Description**: Develop the main container component that will hold the entire roadmap table. This component will manage the overall structure and layout.
-   **Effort**: 2 hours
-   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    -   A new file `frontend/src/components/RoadmapTable.jsx` is created.
    -   The component renders a basic structure for the roadmap view.

**Task 2: Create `ProductSection` Component**

-   **Description**: Create a component to render a single product's section, including its table with the three required columns.
-   **Effort**: 3 hours
-   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    -   A new file `frontend/src/components/ProductSection.jsx` is created.
    -   The component accepts product data as props and renders a table with "Carry-over status", "Roadmap status", and "Item name" columns.

**Task 3: Create `RoadmapItem` Component**

-   **Description**: Create a component to render a single row (a roadmap item) within a product's table. This component will handle the hyperlink for the item name.
-   **Effort**: 2 hours
-   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    -   A new file `frontend/src/components/RoadmapItem.jsx` is created.
    -   The component correctly renders the data for a single roadmap item.
    -   The "Item name" is a clickable link that opens the Jira URL in a new tab.

**Task 4: Integrate Components into `RoadmapView`**

-   **Description**: Replace the existing content of the `RoadmapView` page with the new `RoadmapTable` component and connect it to the data fetched from the API.
-   **Effort**: 3 hours
-   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    -   The `frontend/src/pages/RoadmapView.jsx` file is updated to use the `RoadmapTable` component.
    -   The roadmap page displays the new table view with data from the API.

**Task 5: Implement Filtering Logic**

-   **Description**: Add state management to the `RoadmapView` to handle user selections from the filter components. The logic will filter the data passed to the `RoadmapTable` and hide columns that are empty after filtering.
-   **Effort**: 4 hours
-   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    -   The roadmap view updates correctly when filters are applied.
    -   Columns that have no data for the filtered results are hidden from view.

**Task 6: Apply Material Design Styling**

-   **Description**: Style all new components using a Material Design component library (e.g., MUI for React) to ensure the UI is modern and consistent with the specification.
-   **Effort**: 3 hours
-   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    -   The roadmap table and its elements have a professional, modern look and feel that aligns with Material Design principles.

### Testing

**Task 7: Unit Tests for New Components**

-   **Description**: Write unit tests for the `RoadmapTable`, `ProductSection`, and `RoadmapItem` components to ensure they render correctly with various props.
-   **Effort**: 4 hours
-   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    -   Unit tests are created for each new component.
    -   Tests cover different states, such as with and without data.
    -   All unit tests pass.

**Task 8: Integration Tests for `RoadmapView`**

-   **Description**: Write integration tests for the `RoadmapView` page to verify the complete functionality, including data rendering and filtering.
-   **Effort**: 4 hours
-   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    -   Integration tests cover the user flow of loading the page and applying filters.
    -   Tests assert that the table updates correctly based on filter selections.
    -   All integration tests pass.
