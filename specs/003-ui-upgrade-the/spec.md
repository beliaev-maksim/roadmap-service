# Feature Specification: Modernize Roadmap View

**Feature Branch**: `003-ui-upgrade-the`  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "UI upgrade. The application should display a modern table-style view, suitable for 2025 standards. Each product should have its own section with three columns: Carry-over status (if applicable), Roadmap status, Item name, which should be a hyperlink to the related Jira epic or objective. When selectors are used, the filtered out columns should disappear from the view."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - View Modernized Roadmap (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to see the roadmap in a modern table format so I can easily understand the status of different products.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the feature and provides the primary user value.

**Independent Test**: The modernized table view can be tested independently by loading the roadmap page and verifying the new layout and data presentation without any filtering functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user navigates to the roadmap page, **When** the page loads, **Then** the roadmap is displayed in a table-style view.
2. **Given** the roadmap table is visible, **When** a user inspects the page, **Then** each product has its own dedicated table, each table is located right to other product tables.
3. **Given** a product table section is visible, **When** a user views the columns, **Then** "Carry-over status", "Roadmap status", and "Item name" columns are present.
4. **Given** an item has an associated Jira ticket, **When** a user views the "Item name", **Then** it is a hyperlink to the corresponding Jira epic or objective.

### User Story 2 - Filter Roadmap View (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to filter the roadmap view so I can focus on the information that is relevant to me.

**Why this priority**: Filtering is a key enhancement that makes the roadmap view more usable for different stakeholders.

**Independent Test**: Filtering can be tested by applying various filter combinations and verifying that the table view updates correctly, including the hiding of empty columns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the roadmap tables are visible, **When** a user applies a filter, **Then** the page updates to show only the tables that match the filter criteria.


### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when there is no roadmap data to display? The view should show an informative message.
- How does the system handle a hyperlink to a Jira item that the user does not have permission to view? The link should still go to the Jira URL; Jira will handle the permissions.
- What happens if a filter combination results in no data? The view should show a "No results found" message.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The application MUST display the roadmap data in a table-style view.
- **FR-002**: Each product MUST be displayed in its own section within the table.
- **FR-003**: Each product section MUST have three columns: "Carry-over status", "Roadmap status", and "Item name".
- **FR-004**: The "Item name" MUST be a hyperlink to the associated Jira epic or objective if one exists.
- **FR-005**: The view MUST be filterable by department, team, and product release.
- **FR-006**: When filters are applied, any columns that become empty across all visible rows MUST be hidden from view.
- **FR-007**: The UI MUST be modern and align with 2025 design standards, following Google's Material Design guidelines.

## Assumptions

- The existing filtering components for department, team, and product release will be reused.
- The data source for the roadmap provides all the necessary information (carry-over status, roadmap status, item name, Jira link).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of roadmap items are accurately displayed in the new table view.
- **SC-002**: Users can filter the roadmap by all available filter options, and the view updates in under 1 second.
- **SC-003**: The initial page load time for the roadmap view with all data is under 2 seconds.
- **SC-004**: A user satisfaction survey indicates a positive response to the new UI from at least 80% of users.
