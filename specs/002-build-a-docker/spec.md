  **Feature Specification: Build Docker Image & GitHub CI for Automated and Manual QA**

  **Feature Branch**: `002-build-a-docker`
  **Created**: 2025-10-07
  **Status**: Draft
  **Input**: User description: "build a docker image and github CI to run and test it. We also need to perform manual QA, thus, provide instructions how to start the image locally"

  ## User Scenarios & Testing

  ### User Story 1 - Automated CI Build and Test (Priority: P1)
  As a developer, I want every commit to trigger a GitHub CI workflow that builds the Docker image and runs all automated tests, so that I can ensure code quality and deployment readiness.
  **Why this priority**: Automated CI is critical for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions before code is merged or deployed.
  **Independent Test**: Push a commit to the repository and verify that the CI workflow builds the Docker image and runs all tests successfully.
  **Acceptance Scenarios**:
  1. **Given** a new commit is pushed, **When** the CI workflow runs, **Then** the Docker image is built and all tests pass or fail with clear reporting.
  2. **Given** a failed test, **When** the CI workflow completes, **Then** the failure is reported in the GitHub UI.

  ### User Story 2 - Manual QA via Local Docker Run (Priority: P2)
  As a QA engineer or developer, I want to be able to run the built Docker image locally with clear instructions, so that I can manually test the application in a production-like environment.
  **Why this priority**: Manual QA is essential for catching issues not covered by automated tests and for validating user experience before release.
  **Independent Test**: Follow provided instructions to start the Docker image locally and verify the application is accessible and functional.
  **Acceptance Scenarios**:
  1. **Given** the Docker image is built, **When** a user follows the instructions to run it locally, **Then** the application starts and is accessible for manual testing.

  ### User Story 3 - Clear Documentation for QA and Developers (Priority: P3)
  As a team member, I want clear, step-by-step documentation for building, running, and testing the Docker image both in CI and locally, so that onboarding and QA are efficient and error-free.
  **Why this priority**: Good documentation reduces onboarding time and ensures consistent QA and development practices.
  **Independent Test**: Review documentation and follow steps to build, run, and test the Docker image without external help.
  **Acceptance Scenarios**:
  1. **Given** the documentation is available, **When** a new team member follows it, **Then** they can successfully build, run, and test the Docker image.

  ### Edge Cases
  - What happens if the Docker build fails due to missing dependencies?
  - How does the system handle test failures in CI?
  - What if the local environment lacks Docker or required resources?
  - How are environment variables and secrets managed for local vs CI runs?

  ## Requirements

  ### Functional Requirements
  - **FR-001**: System MUST provide a Dockerfile that builds the application image for both backend and frontend components.
  - **FR-002**: System MUST provide a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the Docker image and runs all automated tests on every commit and pull request.
  - **FR-003**: System MUST provide clear, step-by-step instructions for running the Docker image locally for manual QA.
  - **FR-004**: System MUST report build and test results in the GitHub UI for all CI runs.
  - **FR-005**: System MUST document environment variables and configuration needed for both CI and local runs.
  - **FR-006**: System MUST handle secrets and sensitive configuration securely in CI and local environments using GitHub Secrets for CI and a `.env` file for local development.
  - **FR-007**: System MUST provide separate Docker images for backend and frontend services, following best practices for modularity and scalability.

  ### Key Entities
  - **Docker Image**: Encapsulates the application (backend and frontend), dependencies, and configuration for deployment and testing.
  - **CI Workflow**: Automates build, test, and reporting for every commit and pull request.
  - **Manual QA Instructions**: Documentation for running and testing the Docker image locally.

  ## Success Criteria

  ### Measurable Outcomes
  - **SC-001**: Every commit triggers a CI workflow that builds the Docker image and runs all tests, with results reported in GitHub.
  - **SC-002**: At least 95% of CI runs complete successfully without manual intervention.
  - **SC-003**: Team members can follow documentation to run the Docker image locally and access the application for manual QA within 10 minutes.
  - **SC-004**: All environment variables and configuration required for CI and local runs are documented and accessible to the team.
  - **SC-005**: No sensitive information is exposed in CI logs or Docker images.

  ## Assumptions
  - Standard Docker and GitHub Actions practices are followed.
  - Team members have Docker installed locally for manual QA.
  - Automated tests cover both backend and frontend components.
  - Documentation will be maintained alongside code changes.

  1. **Given** a new commit is pushed, **When** the CI workflow runs, **Then** the Docker image is built and all tests pass or fail with clear reporting.
  2. **Given** a failed test, **When** the CI workflow completes, **Then** the failure is reported in the GitHub UI.
