**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

The following gates are derived from the repository Constitution and MUST be
addressed in the plan (attach artifacts or TODOs if not yet available):

- API Contract: A versioned contract (OpenAPI, gRPC proto, or contract doc)
  MUST be attached or referenced for any public API changes. If the work is
  internal-only, state that explicitly and justify.  
- Test Coverage: Provide test-first artifacts: unit/contract/acceptance tests
  (or failing test definitions) covering the feature's public behaviour.  
- Observability: List required metrics, logs, and tracing spans the feature
  will add. Include health/readiness probe changes if applicable.  
- Versioning Impact: Declare whether the change affects public contracts and
  specify the expected semver bump (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH) and migration plan if
  incompatible.  
- Security: Note any security or privilege changes and attach a short threat
  model or approval note if the change expands attack surface or requires
  elevated access.

Use this section to call out any TODOs where artifacts are pending; every
open TODO should be paired with an owner and ETA.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

---

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Technical Context

- **Backend**: The backend is a FastAPI application written in Python 3.11. It currently has an in-memory data store, which will be replaced with a PostgreSQL database.
- **Frontend**: The frontend is a React application that communicates with the backend via a REST API.
- **Data Source**: The primary data source will be Jira. Data will be fetched from the Jira API and stored in the PostgreSQL database.
- **Dependencies**:
    - `jira`: A Python library for interacting with the Jira API.
    - `psycopg2-binary`: A PostgreSQL adapter for Python.
    - `SQLAlchemy`: An ORM for Python to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
- **Integrations**:
    - **Jira**: The application will integrate with the Jira API to fetch roadmap data. This will require a JQL query to be constructed to fetch the correct data.
    - **PostgreSQL**: The application will use a PostgreSQL database to store the roadmap data.
- **Unknowns**:
    - The exact JQL query needed to fetch the roadmap data from Jira.
    - The specific mapping of Jira issue fields to the roadmap data model.
    - The best way to handle authentication with the Jira API (e.g., API token, OAuth).

### Constitution Check

| Principle | Compliant? | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| I. API Contract First | Yes | The existing OpenAPI contract will be updated to reflect the new data model and endpoints. |
| II. Test-First | Yes | New unit and integration tests will be written for the Jira sync logic and the new database layer. |
| III. Observability & Debuggability | Yes | Structured logging and metrics will be added to the Jira sync process to monitor its health and performance. |
| IV. Semantic Versioning & Release Discipline | Yes | The API version will be bumped to reflect the changes to the data model and endpoints. |
| V. Security & Least Privilege | Yes | Jira API credentials will be stored securely as environment variables and will have read-only access to the Jira project. |

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Status**: Complete

**Artifacts**:
- `research.md`
- `data-model.md`
- `contracts/openapi.yaml`
- `quickstart.md`

---

## Phase 2: Implementation & Testing

### Tasks

- **Backend**:
    - Implement the database schema based on `data-model.md`.
    - Implement the Jira sync logic to fetch data from the Jira API and store it in the database.
    - Update the API to serve roadmap data from the database.
    - Add unit and integration tests for the new functionality.
- **Frontend**:
    - No changes are required for the frontend in this phase.
- **DevOps**:
    - Update the Docker Compose file to include a PostgreSQL service.
    - Update the CI/CD pipeline to run the new tests.
- **Documentation**:
    - Update the project's `README.md` with instructions on how to set up and run the Jira integration.
