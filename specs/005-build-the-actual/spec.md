# Feature Specification: Jira Integration for Roadmap Data

**Feature Branch**: `005-build-the-actual`  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build the actual logic to pull data from Jira and load it into psql. API service now should read data from psql to serve frontend with this data. Tests should be enhanced with pulling psql docker image, loading mocked data and checking that frontend can handle it. Manual QA steps should be documented and include how to start e2e tests and fetch some data from jira to check in frontend"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Up-to-Date Roadmap (Priority: P1)

As a Product Manager, I want to see roadmap data sourced from Jira displayed in the web application, so that I have a single, up-to-date view of our product roadmap.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the feature, ensuring that the roadmap application reflects the ground truth in Jira.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering a sync from a sample Jira project and verifying that the roadmap items appear correctly in the UI, without needing any other user stories.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the system is configured to connect to a Jira project, **When** a data synchronization is triggered, **Then** the roadmap view displays items corresponding to the issues in that Jira project.
2. **Given** an issue is updated in Jira (e.g., status change), **When** the next data synchronization occurs, **Then** the roadmap view reflects that updated information.

### User Story 2 - Ensure Data Integrity with Realistic Tests (Priority: P2)

As a Developer, I want the application's automated tests to run against a real database instance (PostgreSQL), so that I can be confident that the data layer is working correctly before deploying.

**Why this priority**: Guarantees the reliability of the data persistence and retrieval logic, reducing bugs in production.

**Independent Test**: The automated test suite for the API can be run in isolation, confirming that it correctly interacts with a test database (creating, reading, updating data).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the automated test suite is initiated, **When** the tests run, **Then** a temporary PostgreSQL database is provisioned and seeded with mock data.
2. **Given** the tests are complete, **When** the test runner exits, **Then** the temporary database is torn down automatically.

### User Story 3 - Enable Effective Quality Assurance (Priority: P3)

As a QA Engineer, I want clear instructions on how to run end-to-end tests and perform manual verification with live Jira data, so that I can efficiently validate new features and bug fixes.

**Why this priority**: Empowers the QA team to independently verify the full functionality of the feature, ensuring high-quality releases.

**Independent Test**: A QA engineer can follow the documentation to set up the test environment and run verifications, without needing any other part of the feature to be explained.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a QA engineer has access to the project documentation, **When** they follow the "Manual QA" steps, **Then** they can successfully trigger a Jira sync and see the results in the application.
2. **Given** the documentation, **When** a QA engineer needs to run automated end-to-end tests, **Then** they can execute the test script and see a clear pass/fail result.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the Jira API is unavailable during a sync?
- How does the system handle Jira issues that are missing required fields for the roadmap?
- What is the behavior if the database connection is lost during a data write operation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST periodically synchronize roadmap data from a designated Jira project into its own database.
- **FR-002**: The API service MUST serve all roadmap data directly from its PostgreSQL database.
- **FR-003**: The system's automated test suite MUST execute against a dedicated test database instance.
- **FR-004**: The test suite MUST pre-populate the test database with consistent, mocked roadmap data before running tests.
- **FR-005**: The project documentation MUST include a section for Manual QA, detailing the steps to run end-to-end verification.
- **FR-006**: The Manual QA documentation MUST provide instructions for triggering a data sync from Jira and verifying the updated data in the user interface.
- **FR-007**: The data synchronization process MUST be configurable to connect to a specific Jira instance and project using environment variables.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST handle connection failures to Jira gracefully by continuing to serve the last successfully synchronized data (stale data).
- **FR-009**: The system MUST map Jira issue fields to the internal roadmap data model using a standard, predefined mapping.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Roadmap Item**: Represents a single piece of work on the roadmap (e.g., an epic, feature, or task). Attributes include a title, description, status, release, and team assignment.
- **Jira Configuration**: Represents the settings needed to connect to a Jira instance, including URL, project key, and authentication credentials.

### Assumptions
- The Jira instance will be accessible from the environment where the application is running.
- The credentials provided for the Jira connection will have sufficient permissions to read the necessary data.
- The structure of the data in Jira (e.g., the fields on an Epic) is consistent and known.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Roadmap data displayed in the frontend is identical to the data in the corresponding Jira project within 5 minutes of a synchronization event.
- **SC-002**: The automated test suite successfully runs end-to-end, from the database to the frontend, with a 100% pass rate on the main branch.
- **SC-003**: A non-developer (e.g., QA engineer) can successfully execute the documented manual QA steps and verify data from Jira in the UI without developer assistance.
- **SC-004**: The API response time for roadmap data remains under 500ms for a typical user view, even when served from the database.
